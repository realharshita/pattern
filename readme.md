# Spirograph-like Pattern Drawing using Turtle

This project demonstrates how to use the Turtle class in JavaScript to draw a spirograph-like pattern on a canvas.

## Description

The script uses the Turtle class to create an intricate pattern of overlapping circles, resembling a spirograph. It calculates the position and rotation of each circle to produce a visually appealing design.

## Features

- Draws a spirograph-like pattern with overlapping circles.
- Uses rotations and movements to create a dynamic and artistic effect.

## Requirements

- This script requires a JavaScript environment that supports the execution of the Turtle class and drawing on a canvas.

## Installation

No installation is required beyond ensuring your JavaScript environment can execute the script.

## Usage

1. Adjust the canvas dimensions (`max_x` and `max_y`) in the script if needed.
2. Customize the pattern by modifying the `numCircles`, `radius`, and `rotation` variables to change the number of circles, radius of each circle, and overall pattern complexity.
3. Execute the script in your JavaScript environment.(https://blot.hackclub.com/editor?guide=start)
